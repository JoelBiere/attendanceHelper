X offer delete roster button

TODO

/ manual manipulation of student rosters
    --offer a form, for student_name, ID number, dropdown of class_names, (store session id), and session username

/ take attendance 
    --upload csv file, select which class its for, then print out info



/ debugging
    - don't allow stuff like
        -duplicate class class_names
        - empty class class_names
        - files that don't match the specified format
        








Design thoughts

1. in roster management I need a SQL TABLE that a user can interact with

--offer a quick upload from the xlsx file

--this will change how the program runs
    ---specifically 
        in helpers.py 
            powerschoolDataparser()
                --this should still be offered--but as a quick upload and should still return a dict--but store that dict in the sql table appropirately
        in app.py
            takeAttendance()
                --adapt to the changes from powerschoolDataparser
