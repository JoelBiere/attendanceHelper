X lock down login and register process

2. Questions to answer:
    where do I include the uploading procedure?
        - all I need from the roster files is the dict
        -perhaps there is a way to have users create new variable, upload the roster file, 
          then a dict is created in python, BONUS: display the current roster to the user in a html table

          How are the rosters stored? cookies? databases? how would that db be structured?

    design the take attendance page



Design thoughts

1. in roster management I need a SQL TABLE that a user can interact with

--offer a quick upload from the xlsx file

--this will change how the program runs
    ---specifically 
        in helpers.py 
            powerschoolDataparser()
                --this should still be offered--but as a quick upload and should still return a dict--but store that dict in the sql table appropirately
        in app.py
            takeAttendance()
                --adapt to the changes from powerschoolDataparser
